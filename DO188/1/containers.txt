------All the podman cmds are applied to docker just replace podman with docker.------

podman images       -will give the list of images.
podman ps       -will provie list of running processes.
podman run repo     -will run a particular image in foreground.
podman rmi id       -will remove image with assigned id
podman run -d       -will run in bg instead of foreground(-d often known as detach mode)
podman run -e       -can pass enviornment variables in the image(every time flag '-e' must be inserted for every variable).
podman run -p       -will run on specified port.(8888:8889 now here one of them is assigned as port of node.)
podman start 'name' -will restart the container. 
podman run --name 'name'    -will assign name to the image.
podman ps --format='json'   -will give result in queried format.
podman stop 'name/id'       -will stop the conatiner but it is present still to remove it completely use podman rm 'name/id'.
podman rm 'name/id'     -will remove the container.
podman run --rm         -will remove the conatiner as soon as you stop the container.
podman-desktop  -will run podman desktop 
podman-desktop &-will run podman desktop in detach mode.
podman run --rm -will remove the conatiner as soon as you stop the container.
podman exec -it 'name/id' 'cmd' -will execute and give you a interactive terminal for that named container.


docker container ls -will give list of all running containers.
docker stop $(docker --format "{{.ID}}" -q)- will stop all the running conatiners. .ID will list id's and replace .ID with .Tag >Repository .Size .CreatedAt for desired output. Combining can prove powerful cmds skipping multi-step cmds.
docker cmd --filter key:value -filter-out desired output according to need and for key:value pair refer to docker docs.

note:: when using podman run at least one container must be included in the cmd.And everytime you try to run the container you need to specify the image.
