whatever pods you create they are somehow attached to podman bridge but it does not have DNS resolution name service.


podman network create 'name'	-will create new network. 
podman network ls	-will list all the available network
podman network inspect 'nameOfBridge'	-will provide details about that bridge in json format.
podman run --rm	-will remove the conatiner as soon as you stop the container.
podman exec
