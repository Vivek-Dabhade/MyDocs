if [[ $i == "N" ]] #Note the spaces and square braces are very crucial while going through these conditions.


Note that there must be spaces between the brackets and their enclosing text. An or condition is || and an and condition is &&. Also note that then is required after if and elif but not after else. It must be separated from the conditional by either a newline or a ; which represents a newline to bash. The entire if clause is terminated with fi.
