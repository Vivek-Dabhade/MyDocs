read -p "-p Allows to add text before variable for better understanding" var
read -s "-s Slients the input str ****":
read -r	 -raw input to avoid backslash as a special character.
read -N1 -takes 1 letter as an input.
cut -c 4 -will index to the 4th character directly.



				##Conditional Statements##
if [[ condition ]]
then
	do this
elif [[ condition ]]; then
	do this
else
	do this by default
fi 

if [[ $i == "N" ]] #Note the spaces and square braces are very crucial while going through these conditions.


Note that there must be spaces between the brackets and their enclosing text. An or condition is || and an and condition is &&. Also note that then is required after if and elif but not after else. It must be separated from the conditional by either a newline or a ; which represents a newline to bash. The entire if clause is terminated with fi.


					Example

Given three integers (, , and ) representing the three sides of a triangle, identify whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral.

If all three sides are equal, output EQUILATERAL.
Otherwise, if any two sides are equal, output ISOSCELES.
Otherwise, output SCALENE.

read x
read y
read z

if [[ "$x" -eq "$y" && "$y" == "$z" ]]
then 
    echo "EQUILATERAL"
elif [[ "$x" -eq "$y" || "$y" == "$z" || "$x" == "$z" ]]
then
    echo "ISOSCELES"
else
    echo "SCALENE"
fi

-Note u cannot compare more than two things at a time to do so add 'and condition' to continue.
For numeric comparisons, use the [[ ... ]] construct with operators like -eq (equal), -ne (not equal), -gt (greater than), -ge (greater than or equal), -lt (less than), and -le (less than or equal).

-For string comparisons, use the [[ ... ]] construct with operators like == (equal), != (not equal), < (less than, lexicographically), and > (greater than, lexicographically). Note that < and > require escaping or using a different context if they are not within [[ ]].
-String comparisons using == and != are case-sensitive by default.

-You can combine multiple comparison conditions using logical operators:
&& and ||
and [[ ... ]] vs. [ ... ]:
-The [[ ... ]] construct is generally preferred in modern Bash scripting as it offers more features and better handling of whitespace and word splitting compared to the older [ ... ] (test command).
